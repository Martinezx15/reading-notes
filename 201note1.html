        <h2>Types of Fishing</h2> 
        <p>Subsistence Fishing.  Many people rely on fish as a major food source</p>
        <p> Trolling Fishing. Trolling requires a boat or canoe if it is allowed in you National Park.</p>
        <p> Jigging Fishing. Jigging requires a specific type of hook and motion to catch fish.</p>

       
                  
        <p>There is no need to convince the thousands of Virginians and avid outdoors men and women, who get excited by reeling in a 30-pound striper or seeing a beautiful brook trout rise to a fly, why they need to start making plans to head outside. But if for some reason, you need a little convincing, we have compiled a list of 10 good examples that might just offer you an excuse to call in sick to work or leave those “honey do’s” for another weekend so you too can spend a day fishing</p>
        <p>Stress Relief: Ask most anglers why they enjoy spending time in the outdoors and you're likely to hear the word “freedom.” Spending a day afield casting for trout on a cool mountain stream or bobber fishing for bluegills on a pond helps to release us from our highly stressful, everyday environment. Nothing brings on the sense of being alive and helps to rebuild our personal reserves like a day spent interacting with nature.</p>
        <p>ishing for Food: Wild fish are low in fat and cholesterol and high in protein. In fact, the American Heart Association recommends a regular diet of fish. Besides it’s a lot more challenging to catch that plate of fresh fish than to stroll endlessly down a supermarket aisle if you decide to keep your catch.</p>
