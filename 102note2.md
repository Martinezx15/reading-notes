# **Choosing A Text Editor**

- ## **What is a text editor?** 
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a website. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

- ## **What features should you look for in a text editor?** 
I would say some of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. You might find some other features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good start.

- ## **Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer.**
Now that we’ve talked about some of the features one might be interested in if they were interested in a text editor. Let’s talk about some of your options—beginning with the software that comes on your computer. Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”

- ## **Third-Party Options Ok, what about third-party options?** 
Let’s talk about software like: Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are widely used in web development today. NotePad++ 

- ## **The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs**
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one software package.

# **The Command Line!**

## **Your window into the computer.**
Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX. This tutorial won't focus on these as I reckon you can probably figure that part out by yourself. This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash.
The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting. Don't worry, with a bit of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend. Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it. While you can leave the GUI alltogether, most people open up a command line interface just as another window on their desktop (in fact you can have as many open as you like). This is also to our advantage as we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time. We can also easily jump back to the GUI when it suits us. Experiment until you find the setup that suits you best. As an example I will typically have 3 terminals open: 1 in which I do my working, another to bring up ancilliary data and a final one for viewing Manual pages (more on these later).
## **So what are they exactly?**
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands. Here is an example:
drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin
drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents
drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html


## Things I want to know more about
- text editor
- IDEs

## **Opening a Terminal**
Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different but here are a few places to start looking.
If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .

## **The Shell, Bash**
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.

## **Shortcuts** 
The terminal may seem daunting but don't fret. Linux is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier. You'll be introduced to several of them throughout this tutorial. Take note of them as not only do they make your life easier, they often also save you from making silly mistakes such as typos.
Here's your first shortcut. When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.
