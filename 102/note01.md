# ***MARKDOWN***
## **Here are my notes about markdown**
:computer: :desktop_computer
Markdown was designed to make it easier for web writers to work with articles in an age where web publishing required writing HTML. So, the intent was to make it simpler to interface with text formatting in HTML. It wasn’t the first simplified syntax on the planet, but it was the one that gained the most traction over the years. Today, the usage of Markdown has grown far beyond its design intent to be a simpler way to read and write HTML, to become an approach of marking up plain text in a lot of different contexts. Sure, technologies and ideas can evolve beyond their intent, but the tension in today’s use of Markdown can be traced to this origin and the constraints put into its design.

For any markup that is not covered by Markdown’s syntax, you simply use HTML itself. There’s no need to preface it or delimit it to indicate that you’re switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use the tags.       (— John Gruber)
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that describes how text should look on a page. HTML is another example of a markup language. Markdown is a style of writing documents that makes it easy to define what the content should look like. It describes headers, text styles, links, lists and so much more.

 ## **Basic writing and formatting syntax**            
 - Headings: To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.           
 - Styling text: You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.            
  Bold ** ** or __ __, Italic * * or _ _, Strikethrough ~~ ~~ , Bold and nested italic ** ** and _ _, All bold and italic *** ***, 
- Quoting code: You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
- Supported color models: In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color. 
- Links: You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

 - Relative links: You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.  
  A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:
 -Images: You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().
 ![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)
 - Lists:You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with -, *, or +. 
 - Nested Lists: You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item. To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Visual Studio Code, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it. 
- Task lists:To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].
- Using emoji: You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:, Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result. 
- Paragraphs: You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text
- Footnotes: You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax: Here is a simple footnote[^1].
- Hiding content with comments: You can tell GitHub to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.
- Ignoring Markdown formatting: You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character. Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.r
