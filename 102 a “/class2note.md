# **Choosing A Text Editor**

## **What is a text editor?**
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a website. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
  
## **What features should you look for in a text edito?**
I would say some of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. You might find some other features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good start.

# **Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer.**  
Now that we’ve talked about some of the features one might be interested in if they were interested in a text editor. Let’s talk about some of your options—beginning with the software that comes on your computer. Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.” 
 
 ## **Third-Party Options**
Ok, what about third-party options? Let’s talk about software like:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
widely used in web development today.
 
## **The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs**
text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one software package
