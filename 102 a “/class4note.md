## **The HTML**
## **The structure of a webpage with HTML**
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
  
## **HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:**>
- Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
- Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
- Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word. 
It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. 

## **How Does HTML Work**  
- The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files
- HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.
- All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element.

 Now that we’ve talked about some of the features one might be interested in if they were interested in a text editor. Let’s talk about some of your options—beginning with the software that comes on your computer. Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”
 
## **The three main parts of an element are:**
- Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag <p> to create a paragraph.
- Content – this is the output that other users see.
- Closing tag – the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the element name. For example, </p> to end a paragraph. 
The combination of these three parts will create an HTML element.
